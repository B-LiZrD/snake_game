Days 20 and 21 of 100

Added a food module and scoreboard module respectively (to add onto day 20). A challenge was having it detect a collision with the wall, or itself. This was the new greatest challenge for me.

I later went back and changed the shape of the food from a blue egg to a turtle. Also later added a high-score feature. So it remembers the highest score attained even after the program has closed.
